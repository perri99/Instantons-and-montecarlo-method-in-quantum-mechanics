# Instantons-and-montecarlo-method-in-quantum-mechanics
Project for "Theoretical and numerical aspects of Nuclear Physics" Unibo course. \
The aim of this project is to implement montecarlo techniques in the study of a quantum mechanical problem. In this context we studied a non relativistic particle in a double well potential and tried to understand the role of tunneling events (instantons).
